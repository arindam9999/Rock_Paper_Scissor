This project is implemented by me for gaining practical experience and educating my self on the subtleties to multiclass classification using Pretrained networks and fine-tuning of such models. In this project, the base-model used was MobileNetV2 from Keras Library pre-trained on Imagenet Dataset. Finetuned it to get a training accuracy of 88% and test accuracy of 85% using only 800 images(200 of each category). The model used Global Average Pooling layer and Softmax Cost function. No dense layer was used. This model trained for 10 epochs with a learning rate equal to 0.0001 and batch size 64. Fine-tuning the results with greater precision and training the model with higher epochs could possibly improve the accuracy of the model. The project includes the all files , datasets, and pre-trained model weights. The model was trained on Google Colab and took 30mins to run 10 epochs.
